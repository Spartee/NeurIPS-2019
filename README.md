## NeurIPS 2019 Notes

This repository is a collection of the papers and my notes from attended talks and other various parts of NeurIPS 2019.
I created this repository mostly for my own sake, but also because I found it painstaking to find the papers and slides
for the various talks I wanted to go to. Included also are my personal notes that will be updated as the week goes on.

## Notes
The notes are taken in org format and exported to the Read The Docs format for ease of use. The links within the notes
will either point to local papers within the repository or outside links.
