* NeurIPS 2019 
  This repository is a collection of the papers and my notes from attended talks
  and other various parts of NeurIPS 2019. I created this repository mostly for my
  own sake, but also because I found it painstaking to find the papers and slides
  for the various talks I wanted to go to. Included also are my personal notes that
  will be updated as the week goes on.
