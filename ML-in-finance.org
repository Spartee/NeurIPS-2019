* JP Morgan RL in Financial Markets
  - financial markets are difficult for RL because of market impact
** Action Space
   - Small action spaces are easy to learn and large are difficult,
   - To small of an action space, however, and the agent wont be
     adaquately enabled for its market
** Testing
   - simulation? How do you simulate the financial markets? How can you
     trust that the model will accurately capture the markets?
   - What metric to use for offline performance evaluation?
** Rewards in RL
   - Naive objective would be to increase profit
   - but how does that account for underdelivering? market impact?


* Two Sigma - Forecasting Financial Returns using ML
** Speakers
   - Dai Shi
   - Xiang Zhou
** Efficent market hypothesis
   - Two Sigma claims market not at efficent as it may seem
   - Opportunies in the irrationalities of the market
** Identifying opportunity
   - Using ML to find mispriced securities
   - Can we predict equity returns?
*** Example
     - Data source: instagram
     - metric: product popularity
     - predict: current and future price of the stock
     - Use mutliple models for multiple tasks
**** Instagram Example Subproblems
      - How to locate the product in a post? (region based CNN)
      - How to match the product to a company?
      - How to predict the sentiment strength? (bert)
** Workflow
   - ideation, data, forecast research, simulation, release
** Build a model from historical data that will forcast unseen future
   - (out of sample, test) select a period in historical data and pretend its unseen future
   - (in sample, train) Hide and research the stategy with the rest of the historical data
   - Start with a hypothesis
     - For example: Product Popularity -> Stock Returns
   - Make the hypothesis testable
     - Postive sentiment incomments -> positive future 90 day returns
